This mod prevents log spamming with OpenGL errors when Xaero World Map and Sodium are installed.

This is a temporary workaround until
[the issue](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map/issues/717) is fixed.

This is a fork of https://github.com/AdamRaichu/suppress-OpenGL-1280 adapted for another issue.
